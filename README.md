# Lobster Larvae Collectors

## Abstract

Starting in 2008, first-year recruits (i.e. young-of-the-year) of Atlantic lobster (*Homarus americanus*) and small rock crab (*Cancer irroratus*) were counted and measured using larval settlement collectors at various coastal sampling sites in the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Canada. This project is part of the Atlantic Lobster Settlement Index (**ALSI**) program which spans a large part of the species' western Atlantic range, from Cape cod, the Gulf of Maine, the Bay of Fundy, the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence, coastal Nova Scotia and eastern and northern Newfoundland. 

## Methods

Larvae collectors are specially constructed cages containing suitable substrate, i.e. gravel and rocks deemed suitable for settlement crustacean larvae. Sets of 30 collectors are placed at each site. Collectors are deployed in early summer and rertrieved during the fall, before and after the larval settlement period, respectively.

In the project's inaugural year in 2008, a more detailed protocol was used to identify the full range of species found in the collectors. This involved bringing the collectors' pet screens to the lab for close examination of the species composition. Species flushed out of the collector during sampling were brought to the lab in a water bottle containing a formaldehyde solution.

Collectors which were misplaced during storms, flipped over or contain silt or sediment accumulated over the sampling season were noted as such.
## Other Research Goals

In addition to providing local young-of-the-year recruitment estimates for lobster and an index of small rock crab, larval collectors data may provide other information of interest (e.g. presence of invasive species).

### Influence of Water Temperature 

Temperature data gathered by attached probes at the collector sampling sites will be analysed to determine the possible influence of temperature on larval recruitment rates. 

### Local Growth Variation

Length-frequency analysis of collector data provide the possibility of identifying, quantifying and estimating the mean sizes of lobster instars. This can provide some insight on variations in local growth and moult patterns.

### Local Landings Prediction

Lobster recruitment indices may  be used to construct a predictive model of future lobster landings when taking growth and mortality into account. This is especially relevant given the scarcity of fishery-independent data for predicting the abundance of commercially-sized lobster.
